 * @brief The class CGNR represents a IterativeSolver which uses the krylov subspace Conjugate
 * Gradients for Normal Residuals (CGNR) method to solve a system of linear equations iteratively.
 * Remarks:
 * 1. assignTranspose is not supported yet for DenseMatrix.
 * 2. The scalars in the algorithm are set to zero if they are smaller then machine
 * precision (3*eps) to avoid devision by zero. In this case the solution doesn't change anymore.
 * 3. In this case it makes less sense to take the residual regarding to some norm itself since 
 * it has to be additionally computed in each iterate() (contrary to e.g. BiCGstab solver;
 * no higher costs).
