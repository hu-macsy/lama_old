Task 3: Enable Solver logging
=============================

The solvers that are implemented in LAMA provide a solver interface to allow
detailed monitoring of their behavior, e.g. plotting of a convergence history.
The aim of this task is to pass a CommonLogger instance to the constructor of
the CG solver of task 0. The logging level should be set to convergenceHistory.
