Solution Task 6
===============

Here is the solution of task 6.

In total there are six logging-levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL with TRACE being the most verbose one.

Setting the environment variable SCAI_LOG with a configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

   export SCAI_LOG=config

Possible configuration in this configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

   <root> = WARN
   Solver.IterativeSolver.CG = INFO
   Matrix.CSRSparseMatrix = DEBUG
   Distribution.BlockDistribution = INFO

   
.. csv-table::
   :header: "back to this Task", "Index", "next Task"
   :widths: 330, 340, 330
