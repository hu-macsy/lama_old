.. _distributed_IO:

Distributed I/O Support in LAMA
===============================

In contrary to a serial program where all data of vectors and/or matrices reside  
in the local memory of one processor, the I/O of distributed data involves some
kind of management to deal with it.

Single I/O
----------

In the single I/O mode, only the first or master processor is responsible for
reading data from and writing data into the file. Therefore data will be
redistributed corresponding to the ``SingleDistribution`` where the 
first processor owns all data.

    Single I/O of Distributed Data.

Advantages:

 * This mode supports all I/O formats that are supported in serial programs.
 * All data is available in a single file.

Disadvantages:

 * Data must be redistributed (involves communication)
 * First processor has to allocate memory for all data
 * Poor performance.

.. code-block:: c++

    FileIO& file = ...;

    auto comm = dmemo::Communicator::getCommunicatorPtr();
    const PartitionId MASTER = 0;

    DenseVector<double> vector;

    // read vector from file in MASTER mode
    {
        HArray<double> localData;
        if ( comm->getRank() == MASTER )
        {
            file.read( localData );
            N = localData.size();
        }
        comm->bcast( N, MASTER );
        vector = DenseVector<double>( singleDistribution( N, comm ), localData );
        vector.redistribute( blockDistribution( N, comm ) ); 
    }
    ....
    // write vector 
    {
        vector.redistribute( singleDistribution (N, comm ) );
        if ( comm->getRank() == MASTER )
        {
            comm->write( vector.getLocalData() );
        }
    }

Independent I/O
---------------

.. figure:: _images/independent_io.*
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
  
    Independent I/O of Distributed Data.

Advantages:

 * This mode supports all I/O formats that are supported in serial programs.
 * Full parallel performance
 * Might use local discs (e.g. fast SSD) of the nodes

Disadvantages:

 * Lots of files to manage
 * Number of processors must match the number of files (reading).
 * Might involve redistribution if data is not block-distributed

When a read or write operation is applied to a *distributed* vector or matrix, it
is just as if the local part is read or written. But as the distribution itself is
not written into the file, the vector or matrix must be block distributed.
This implies a redistribution of the data before a write operation. The read data
will have a general block distribution where the local size corresponds to the
size of the data in the local files.

Note: when writing data with coordinates (vector in sparse format) or COO storage
data, the local files still keep the local coordinates. It might be possible to use
global coordinates and to avoid the redistribution before the write operation.

.. code-block:: c++

    FileIO& file;

    auto comm = dmemo::Communicator::getCommunicatorPtr();

    DenseVector<double> vector;

    // read vector from file in INDEPENDENT mode
    {
        HArray<double> localData;
        file.read( localData );
        vector = DenseVector<double>( genBlockDistribution( localData.size(), comm ), localData );
    }
    ....
    // write vector into file in INDEPENDENT MODE
    {
        if ( !vector.getDistribution().isBlockDistributed() )
        {
            vector.redistribute( blockDistribution( vector.size(), comm ) );
        }
        file.write( vector.getLocalData() );
    }

Collective I/O
---------------

In the collective mode, all processors read from the same 
file or write into it. The module ``dmemo`` provides the ``CollectiveFile`` 
class that can be used to read/write distributed data structures
like vectors and matrices.
 
.. figure:: _images/collective_io.*
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
  
    Collective I/O of Distributed Data.

Advantages:

 * All data resides in one file.
 * Number of processors for read can be different from number of processors for write.
 * Parallel file systems allow efficient implementation of read/write operations
   for collective files.

Disadvantages:

 * Only possible for file formats where processors can read/write from individual offsets.
 * Might involve redistribution if data is not block-distributed

The code for collective I/O looks exactly the same as for the independent IO mode.

Selection of Distributed I/O-Mode
---------------------------------

For most FileIO classes, the MASTER mode is the default mode. If the class supports
the COLLECTIVE mode, this becomes the default mode.
The INDENDENT mode is chosen if the pattern "%r" appears in the file name with the
open method. This placeholder pattern will be replaced with the corresponding rank and size value
of the communcator.

.. code-block:: c++

    #include <scai/lama/io/LamaIO.hpp>

    using namespace scai;

    LamaIO file;

    file.open( "data.lfm", "r" );    // collective mode
    ...
    file.close();

    file.open( "data%r.lfm", "r" );   // independent mode
    ...
    file.close();

    file.setDistributedIOMode( DistributedIOMode::MASTER );
    file.open( "data.lfm", "r" );     // single mode
    ...
    file.close();

When writing distributed data into a file, information about the distribution itself is lost. 
For a single file this does not really matter as the data can be redistributed arbirtrarily after reading
it. When the data is written into multiple files, the information about the mapping is lost, i.e. it is no more known
how the local data maps into the global space.

Read/Write of Distributed Data
-------------------------------

All distributed data structures of LAMA (e.g. Vector or Matrix) provide a method
``readFromFile`` and a method ``writeToFile``. Its only argument is the reference
to an opened file. 

.. code-block:: c++

    FileIO& file = 
    file.open(  ... );
    
    Vector<double>& v = ...;
    Matrix<double>& m = ...;

    v.readFromFile( file );
    m.readFromFile( file );
    ...
    v.writeToFile( file );
    m.writeToFile( file );

Important: each I/O routine of a Vecotor or a Matrix must be called by all processors
of the current communicator.

Instead of a file, it is also possible to pass a filename. By the suffix,
a corresponding file object is created by the FileIO factory.

.. code-block:: c++

    v.readFromFile( "filename.<suffix>" );

    std::unique_ptr<FileIO> file( FileIO::get( "<suffix" ) );
    file->open( "filename.<suffix>", "r" );
    v.readFromFile( *file );
    file->close();

.. code-block:: c++

    // v.writeToFile( "filename.<suffix>" );

    FileIO& file = FileIO::get( "<suffix" );
    file.open( "filename.<suffix>", "w" );
    v.writeToFile( file );
    file.close();

Read/Write of Replicated Data
-----------------------------

* Writing a replicated vector or matrix: it must be called by all processors even if only one
  processor writes it. It contains an implicit synchronization that avoids that the same file
  is read before it is completely written.

.. code-block:: c++

    Vector& v = ...;
    v.redistribute( DistributionPtr( new NoDistribution( v.size() ) ) );
    v.writeToFile( "vector.mtx" )          // implicit synchronization 
    v.readFromFile( "vector.mtx" )


I/O of Distributions
--------------------

A single file contains for each entry the owner.

.. code-block:: c++

   HArray<IndexType> myLocalIndexes = dist->ownedIndexes();
   DenseVector<IndexType> distVector( genBlockDistribution( dist->getLocalSize() ), dist->ownedIndexes() );

   DistributionPtr dist( PartitionIO::readDistribution( "owners.mtx", comm )

.. code-block:: c++

   0   0   1    1   0   0   2   2   3   3   2   2   3   3

A multiple file contains for each processor the owned global indexes.

.. code-block:: c++

   0 :   0  1   4   5
   1 :   2  3   6   7
   2 :   8  9  12  13
   3 :  10 11  14  15

.. code-block:: c++

   PartitionIO::write( distribution, "owners%r.mtx" )

   CommunicatorPtr comm = Communcator::CommuncatorPtr();    // current MPI comm
   DistributionPtr dist( PartitionIO::readDistribution( "owners%r.mtx", comm )

I/O Methods for Vector and Matrix classes
-----------------------------------------

To initialise a ``Matrix`` or ``Vector`` from file just pass the filename to the constructor or the *readFromFile* function.

.. code-block:: c++

   std::string matrixname = ...;
   std::string vectorname = ...;
   CSRSparseMatrix<float> csrMatrix( matrixname );
   
   ELLSparseMatrix<double> ellMatrix();
   ellMatrix.readFromFile( matrixname );
   
   DenseVector<float> vec1( vectorname );

   DenseVector<double> vec2();
   vec2.readFromFile( vectorname );

To write a ``Matrix`` or ``Vector`` to file call *writeToFile* with the name of the output file and the formatting. The default for just giving a name and no formatting is binary SAMG format in internal precision for the *values* und int for *ia* and *ja*.

.. code-block:: c++

   csrMatrix.writeToFile( "matrix_out.mtx", File::MATRIX_MARKET, File::FLOAT );
   vec.writeToFile( "vec_out.frv", File::SAMG_FORMAT, File::DOUBLE, /*binary*/ true ); // binary SAMG format
   
Possible file formats are ``File::SAMG_FORMAT`` and ``File::MATRIX_MARKET``.

Possible data types are ``common::scalar::INDEX_TYPE`` (int), ``common::scalar::FLOAT``, ``common::scalar::DOUBLE``, ``common::scalar::COMPLEX``(ComplexFloat), ``common::scalar::DOUBLE_COMPLEX``, ``common::scalar::LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX`` or ``common::scalar::INTERNAL`` for the internal representation of the data.

Example Program
---------------

In the direcory ``eamples/io`` two example programs are provided that allow nearly each kind of conversion between
different file formats: one for matrices and one for vectors.

.. code-block:: bash

   matrixConvert <infile_name> <outfile_name> [options]
   vectorConvert <infile_name> <outfile_name> [options]

   SCAI_TYPE=[float|double|LongDouble|ComplexFloat|ComplexDouble|ComplexLongDouble

   SCAI_IO_BINARY=flag[:bool]
   SCAI_IO_TYPE_DATA=string[:float|double|ComplexFloat|ComplexDouble]
   SCAI_IO_TYPE_INDEX=[int]
   SCAI_IO_PRECISION=[n:int]
   SCAI_IO_APPEND=flag

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   matrixConvert mhd1280b.mtx mhd1280b.frm --SCAI_TYPE=ComplexDouble

This converts a complex matrix (MatrixMarket) to the binary SAMG format.

.. code-block:: bash

   matrixConvert Emily_923.mtx Emily_923.psc 

This converts a double matrix (MatrixMarket) to the binary PETSC format.

.. code-block:: bash

   matrixConvert matrix.frm file.psc 
   vectorConvert matrix.frv file.psc --SCAI_IO_APPEND=True

This converts a double matrix and a double vector into one single binary PETSC file.
