## Include required scai macros

include ( scai_macro/scai_module )
include ( scai_macro/scai_project )
include ( scai_macro/scai_subdirectories )
include ( scai_macro/scai_library )
include ( scai_function/relative_install )

## Define new SCAI module project with its internal/external dependencies

scai_module(

    MODULE_NAME   partitioning
    INTERNAL_DEPS common logging tracing hmemo kregistry dmemo lama
    EXTERNAL_DEPS Metis 
)

## MetisDistribution only added as source if enabled and IndexType is int

if ( METIS_FOUND AND USE_METIS )
    if ( SCAI_INDEX_TYPE STREQUAL "int" )
        set ( METISPARTITIONING MetisPartitioning )
    endif ()
endif ()

### Add classes/headers to source files CXX_SOURCES, CXX_HEADERS, ...

        Partitioning
        BlockPartitioning

        ${METISPARTITIONING}
    )

## Define library via macro using MODULE_NAME, INTERNAL_DEPS, EXTERNAL_DEPS
## and global variables SCAI_LIBRARY_PREFIX, SCAI_VERSION, ....

scai_library ( PREFIX  ${SCAI_LIBRARY_PREFIX}
               TYPE    ${SCAI_LIBRARY_TYPE}
               VERSION ${SCAI_VERSION}
               ${CXX_SOURCES} )

### install ###
