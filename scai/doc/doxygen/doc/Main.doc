<h2>LAMA System Documentation</h2>

This system documentation has been generated by doxygen from the software documentation within 
the source files of LAMA and its subprojects.

It should be used as a complementary to the LAMA User Documentation that describes more in detail the 
philosophy of LAMA and how it can be used.

This system documentation gives detailed information about classes and their hierarchy and describes
all the methods and their interfaces.
