Some helpful Classes
--------------------

- TestSparseMatrices.hpp

In the class TestSparseMatrices there are precalculated sparse matrices, which can be useful for some tests. If other precalculated Matrices should be added this file is the right place for it.

- EquationHelper.hpp

In the class EquationHelper there are predefined solutionsystems. A system consists of an object of type Matrix, a solutionvector and a rhs-vector.

- TestMacros.hpp

In this file are nearly all used makros for testing: like selfmade assertions, the CONTEXTLOOP and GETCONTEXT or LAMA_AUTO_TEST_CASES_*
