CMake
^^^^^

CMake__ is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.

.. __: https://cmake.org/

LAMA fully relies on CMake as build system. It should find all other LAMA dependent software packages, so the installation of LAMA takes places by only configuring cmake and starting the build process.
