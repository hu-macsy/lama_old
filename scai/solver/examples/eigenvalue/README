Example:fiedler
---------------

Computes the Fiedler vector of a Laplacian matrix.

fiedler.exe <matrix_filename>

If matrix is a pattern format (Matrix Market), please set environment variable

SCAI_IO_TYPE_DATA=_Pattern

Example:

fiedler.exe ~/Matrices/fiedler/bcspwr09.mtx --SCAI_IO_TYPE_DATA=_Pattern
Iter 0, lambda = 1.00058, diff = 0.999709
Iter 1, lambda = 0.015327, diff = 0.0045091
Iter 2, lambda = 0.00432685, diff = 0.000917312
Iter 3, lambda = 0.00397695, diff = 0.000546245
Iter 4, lambda = 0.00361585, diff = 0.00194637
Iter 5, lambda = 0.00279565, diff = 0.000240391
Iter 6, lambda = 0.00210558, diff = 0.00130798
Iter 7, lambda = 0.00189515, diff = 0.000214675
Iter 8, lambda = 0.00186062, diff = 0.000137948
Iter 9, lambda = 0.0018566, diff = 2.21572e-05
Iter 10, lambda = 0.00185621, diff = 1.55032e-05
Iter 11, lambda = 0.00185618, diff = 9.04267e-06

The result is a vector written in eigenvector.mtx. The partitioning in a bipartite graph is given
by nodes with a value > 0 and values < 0.
