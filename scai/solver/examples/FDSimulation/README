You can execute this example by simply calling
$ ./FDSimulation.exe

By default it would execute it on the host (CPU).
You can switch to GPU when you set SCAI_CONTEXT=CUDA before (bash: $ export SCAI_CONTEXT=CUDA).

It should print the configuration of the example and the actual steps to console.

It creates the file seismogram.mtx with the seismogram data. You can plot it by calling gnuplot, creating seismogram.png
$ gnuplot seismogram.gnuplot
