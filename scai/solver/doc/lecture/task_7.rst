Task 7: Performance Visualization with Vampir (optional)
========================================================

Vampir is a tool to measure and visualize the performance of instrumented programs.
During the build process of LAMA it is possible to switch on source
code instrumentation which makes the generation of trace files at runtime possible 
(see ":doc:`../installation/configuration/tracing`").
This is supported by corresponding calls of the VampirTrace library.
So by using LAMA you can also generate Vampir trace files of your
application. Especially for MPI parallel runs, the communication between the
processes is traced to identify communication patterns and to get communication
statistics.

By default, tracing is deactivated at runtime. Tracing can be activated by
setting the environment variable ``SCAI_TRACE``.

.. code-block:: bash

   export SCAI_TRACE=vt

Furthermore, you can also enable tracing for additional running threads 
that will be started for asynchronous computations.

.. code-block:: bash

   export SCAI_TRACE=vt:thread

When using CUDA, CUDA runtime and device activities can be recorded by
setting the following environment variable (of VampirTrace):

.. code-block:: bash

   export VT_GPUTRACE=yes

By using VampirTrace you can take advantage of all the features offered
by this trace library. The hardware counter support is very convenient
for performance analysis. 

.. code-block:: bash

   papi_avail     ! shows supported hardware performance counters
   export VT_METRICS=PAPI_L2_DCR:PAPI_FP_OPS

After a successful run of your application, the generated ``.otf`` files can be
visualized by Vampir.

The most interesting methods of LAMA have been instrumented to identify them as
regions in the trace file. LAMA uses corresponding macros to define code
sections as regions. Each region has a name that should be unique for the whole
application. These macros can also be used in user applications.

Lets try it: With the makro SCAI_REGION("CUDA region") create a new region at
the beginning of your program before setting the CUDA-Context. Use the makros
SCAI_REGION_START("CG-region") and SCAI_REGION_END("CG-region") around the
solve-method() of your CG-Solver to create a second region. Run the program MPI
parallel and open the created \*.otf file with Vampir. To be able to see all of
your regions it is advisable to increase the zoom of the timeline. You can find
a specific region by its name by using Ctrl+F.
