LAMA uses some Boost libraries and therefore you must have an actual version (1.34 or later) installed on your machine.
If the compiler provides support for C++11 only Boost's unit test framework will be used.

The following header-only libraries are used by LAMA (obsolete by using a compiler supporting C++11):

  - **Smart pointers**: avoid to keep track of ownership of dynamically allocated memory
  - **Function**: object wrappers for deferred calls or callbacks.
  - **Bind**: allows to bind arguments for new function pointers

As *compiled* libraries LAMA only uses:

  - **unit_test_framework**: for LAMA's unit tests (recommended)

Many linux installations provide an actual release of Boost and if Boost is installed, the LAMA configuration should
have no problems to find it.

If for any reasons no actual Boost installation is available, you must download and install it. 
Please make sure that you build also the dynamic library versions. After installation of Boost you can tell cmake 
the location of your installation by the variable BOOST_ROOT or by setting an environment variable

.. code-block:: bash

    export BOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost/installation>
    cmake ..

or

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost/installation> ...

Via ccmake you can verify that the Boost variables needed for LAMA have correct values

.. code-block:: bash

    BOOST_ROOT                        <path/to/boost/installation>
    Boost_INCLUDE_DIR                 <path/to/boost/installation>/include
    Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS                <path/to/boost/installation>/lib
    Boost_UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK_LIBRARY <path/to/boost/installation>/lib/libboost_unit_test_framework.so

There are known issues with some older Boost Installations with there own Boost.cmake definition.
If you have error message looking like

.. code-block:: bash

    CMake Error at /usr/lib64/boost/Boost.cmake:536 (message):
    The imported target "boost_date_time-static" references the file

      "/usr/lib64/lib64/libboost_date_time.a"

    but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

    * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

    * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

    * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/usr/lib64/boost/Boost.cmake"

    but not all the files it references.

try using -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=TRUE
