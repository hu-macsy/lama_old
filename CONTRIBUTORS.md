Moritz von Looz-Corswarem
-------------------------

- Contributed a neat algorithm for building redistributors whose target is a general distribution.
  The algorithm significantly improved the asymptotic complexity of the operation in these cases,
  which resulted in very measurable improvements to the scalability of the redistribution scheme
  for general distributions.
