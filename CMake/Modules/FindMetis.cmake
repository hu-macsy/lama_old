#
# Find the METIS includes and libraries
#
# METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning finite element meshes, 
# and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices. The algorithms implemented in METIS
# are based on the multilevel recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint 
# partitioning schemes developed in the Kariypis Lab. 
#
# METIS_FOUND       - Do not attempt to use if "no" or undefined
# METIS_INCLUDE_DIR - the METIS include dir
# METIS_LIBRARIES   - List of fully qualified libraries to link against
