### SCAI_THREAD_LIBRARY - needed Thread library

enable_language ( C )

set ( CMAKE_THREAD_PREFER_PTHREAD 1 )
set ( THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG 1 )

find_package( Threads ${SCAI_FIND_PACKAGE_FLAGS} REQUIRED )
set ( SCAI_THREAD_LIBRARIES ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT} CACHE PATH "Pthread library" )
mark_as_advanced( SCAI_THREAD_LIBRARIES )

###  Here we use PThread library for threads
###  Note: FindThreads in CMake is available as Module, but is buggy, needs update of CheckIncludeFiles.cmake
#find_library ( PTHREADS_LIBRARY NAMES pthread pthreads )
#set ( SCAI_THREAD_LIBRARY ${PTHREADS_LIBRARY} )
