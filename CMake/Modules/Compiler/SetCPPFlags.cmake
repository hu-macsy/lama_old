 # @brief Set additional flags for CXX compiler and linker
 # @author Thomas Brandes

#### compiler dependent flag definition ####
#
#  Input variables: CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX, CMALE_CXX_COMPILER_ID
#
#  Output variables: 
#
#      SCAI_WARNING_FLAGS       : flags will be used only for compilation, suppress/enable warnings
#      SCAI_CXX_FLAGS           : flags used for compilation/linking
#      SCAI_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG     : flags used for compilation/linking, only in Debug mode
#      SCAI_CXX_FLAGS_RELASE    : flags used for compilation/linking, only in Release mode
#      SCAI_CODE_COVERAGE_FLAGS : flags used for compilation/linking, only if code coverage will be enabled
#
#  All variables are only set here and not added for CMAKE variables.
#
#  Note: most common flags will be set by CMAKE itself, like -g for Debug or -O3 for Release, so these
#        flags do not have to be defined here.
