#### Check for -std=c++11
#### if supported it is set to SCAI_LANG_FLAGS
#
#
#  If C++ compiler supports ISO C++11 standard we will use smart pointers (shared_ptr, unique_ptr)
#  and function/bind. If not, features of Boost libraries are employed. 
# 
#  Note: In C++ files the following macro can be used to see if the flag -std=c++11 has been specified:
#  if __cplusplus > 199711L  
#    <code using C++11 features>
#  else
#    <code using boost>
#  endif

# use CMake module that provides CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG 

include ( CheckCXXCompilerFlag )

if ( NOT DEFINED CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )
    CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG( -std=c++11 CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )
endif ( NOT DEFINED CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )

if ( CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )
    set ( SCAI_LANG_FLAGS "-std=c++11" )
else ( CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )
    set ( SCAI_LANG_FLAGS "" )
endif ( CXX_SUPPORTS_C11 )
