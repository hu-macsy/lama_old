tracing
=======

This library supports timing and tracing of C++ programs.

1. Instrumentation

{
    TRACE_REGION_N( "Name_" << 1 )
}

{
    TRACE_REGION( "Name" )
}

2. Running

export LAMA_TRACE=time

 - timing of all traced regions in main thread
 - output file is <executable>.trace

export LAMA_TRACE=time:thread

Attention: using of VampirTrace library needs some more sophisticated library path

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/brandes/local/papi/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64
