## How to build and install LAMA

extract tar.gz and change into folder
 $ tar -xzvf libama-x.x.x.tar.gz
 $ cd libama-x.x.x

create a build directory and change to it
 $ mkdir <build>
 $ cd <build>

configure cmake by giving the install prefix and pointing to the LAMA-src dir:
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/install/dir> [optional options] ../scai

For a Release build be sure to define -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.

start the build and installation process by running make (optionally in parallel):

 $ make [-j <num_processes>]

you optionally can build the system doc (beneath the already installed userdoc) by:

 $ make doxygendoc

make install is not(!) needed (and not possible).
